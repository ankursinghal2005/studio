## Style Guidelines:

- Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and stability, aligning with the serious nature of financial applications. It reflects the structured environment of the OpenGov | General Ledger application.
- Very light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a neutral backdrop that enhances the visibility of the indigo and other UI elements.
- A muted blue (#7986CB), subtly draws attention to interactive elements without overpowering the primary color.
- Use clear and professional DM Sans fonts for labels and menu items to ensure readability.
- Implement a balanced grid layout for the six clickable blocks to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
- Employ minimalist icons within each block to enhance recognition and guide users to the relevant configuration area.
- Use subtle hover effects on the blocks to provide feedback and enhance interactivity.
